# Project Status

## Current phase

Phase 1 — Monorepo and Guardrails (completed)

## Repository baseline

- Git repository root was resolved with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.
- Local repository is empty: no commits and no tracked project files existed.
- Local starting branch was the unborn `main` branch.
- Remote repository was queried directly and returned no refs.
- Work continues on `codex/ai-workflow-platform`.
- No package manager files, source code, dependencies, build scripts, tests, or
  deploy configuration existed at audit time.
- There is therefore no pre-existing build, lint, typecheck, or test command to
  run as a baseline.

## Architecture and risk baseline

- The requested monorepo architecture has no conflict with existing code because
  the repository is empty.
- The highest-risk boundaries are local filesystem authorization, multi-tenant
  database isolation, device-token/job-lease correctness, AI output validation,
  destructive-action approval, and OAuth token protection.
- Desktop release signing and live third-party integration require credentials
  that are intentionally deferred; mock modes must keep local builds and tests
  deterministic.

## Phase 0

Status: completed

### Implemented

- Audited repository root, status, files, package-manager state, and remote refs.
- Created the project rules and phase-by-phase execution plan.
- Established initial architecture, deployment, security, and testing documents.

### Files changed

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
- `docs/STATUS.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `docs/SECURITY.md`
- `docs/TESTING.md`

### Validation

- `pnpm format:check`: not applicable — workspace not created until Phase 1
- `pnpm lint`: not applicable — workspace not created until Phase 1
- `pnpm typecheck`: not applicable — workspace not created until Phase 1
- `pnpm test`: not applicable — workspace not created until Phase 1
- `pnpm build:web`: not applicable — web app not created
- `pnpm build:desktop`: not applicable — desktop app not created

### Known limitations

- This phase intentionally contains no application implementation.
- The Git remote is configured but has not yet been pushed.
- Live Supabase, AI, Google, signing, Vercel, and GitHub Release credentials are
  not available or required for this phase.

### Commit

- `78e16c3` — `chore: audit repository and establish project rules`

## Phase 1

Status: completed

### Implemented

- Added a pnpm workspace with strict Node and pnpm engine requirements and a
  single shared lockfile.
- Added strict shared TypeScript options, ESLint flat configuration, Prettier,
  Vitest, and terminating root quality scripts.
- Added the shared product identity configuration and a unit test so future
  renaming has one source of truth.
- Added dependency, build-output, local-environment, log, database, editor, and
  operating-system ignore rules.
- Added a least-privilege CI baseline with concurrency cancellation and a
  bounded job timeout.
- Resolved the initial TypeScript 7 peer mismatch by selecting the current
  TypeScript 6 line supported by `typescript-eslint`; `pnpm peers check` reports
  no remaining issues.

### Dependency purposes

- TypeScript and Node type definitions: strict cross-package static checking.
- ESLint, `@eslint/js`, and `typescript-eslint`: JavaScript and TypeScript lint
  rules, including explicit bans on `any` and TypeScript suppression comments.
- Prettier: deterministic repository formatting.
- Vitest and its V8 coverage provider: terminating unit tests and coverage.

### Files changed

- Root workspace, package, TypeScript, lint, format, Vitest, ignore, and lock
  files.
- `packages/shared` product configuration and unit test.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Phase documentation formatting and status.

### Validation

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`: passed
- `pnpm peers check`: passed
- `pnpm format:check`: passed
- `pnpm lint`: passed
- `pnpm typecheck`: passed
- `pnpm test`: passed — 1 test
- `pnpm build:web`: not applicable — web app begins in Phase 2
- `pnpm build:desktop`: not applicable — desktop app begins in Phase 8

### Known limitations

- CI includes the required web build step, which becomes runnable after Phase 2.
- The shared support address uses the reserved `.invalid` domain until a real
  support address is configured.
- No application runtime code is part of this guardrail phase.

### Commit

- `chore: initialize monorepo and project guardrails` (this phase commit)
