# Project Status

## Current phase

Phase 0 — Repository Audit (completed)

## Repository baseline

- Git repository root was resolved with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.
- Local repository is empty: no commits and no tracked project files existed.
- Local starting branch was the unborn `main` branch.
- Remote repository was queried directly and returned no refs.
- Work continues on `codex/ai-workflow-platform`.
- No package manager files, source code, dependencies, build scripts, tests, or
  deploy configuration existed at audit time.
- There is therefore no pre-existing build, lint, typecheck, or test command to
  run as a baseline.

## Architecture and risk baseline

- The requested monorepo architecture has no conflict with existing code because
  the repository is empty.
- The highest-risk boundaries are local filesystem authorization, multi-tenant
  database isolation, device-token/job-lease correctness, AI output validation,
  destructive-action approval, and OAuth token protection.
- Desktop release signing and live third-party integration require credentials
  that are intentionally deferred; mock modes must keep local builds and tests
  deterministic.

## Phase 0

Status: completed

### Implemented

- Audited repository root, status, files, package-manager state, and remote refs.
- Created the project rules and phase-by-phase execution plan.
- Established initial architecture, deployment, security, and testing documents.

### Files changed

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
- `docs/STATUS.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `docs/SECURITY.md`
- `docs/TESTING.md`

### Validation

- `pnpm format:check`: not applicable — workspace not created until Phase 1
- `pnpm lint`: not applicable — workspace not created until Phase 1
- `pnpm typecheck`: not applicable — workspace not created until Phase 1
- `pnpm test`: not applicable — workspace not created until Phase 1
- `pnpm build:web`: not applicable — web app not created
- `pnpm build:desktop`: not applicable — desktop app not created

### Known limitations

- This phase intentionally contains no application implementation.
- The Git remote is configured but has not yet been pushed.
- Live Supabase, AI, Google, signing, Vercel, and GitHub Release credentials are
  not available or required for this phase.

### Commit

- `chore: audit repository and establish project rules` (this phase commit)
